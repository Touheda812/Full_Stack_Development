    A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing<br/>
    with a particular point or idea. Though not required by the orthographic <br/>
    conventions of any language with a writing system, paragraphs are a conventional <br/>
    means of organizing extended segments of prose. <br/>
